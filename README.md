## Repository Structure

By default, Cypress comes with a folder structure. The main folder is **cypress,** within which there are subfolders.

- **Fixtures:** If you are using external data inside your tests, your data can be organized inside the Fixtures folder.
- **Screenshots:** Once a run has completed (via the Run All command), the reporting will create screenshot results and add them here when a test fails. Everything under this directory is ignored by GIT to ensure no screenshot information is added to the repository.
- **Support:** The Support folder contains utilities, global commands, frequently used codes, etc. By default, this folder comes with â€“ **commands.js**. Additional files and folders can be added as required.
